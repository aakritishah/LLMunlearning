    Analyze a single response for factual, non-factual, and hallucinated percentages.

    You are an evaluator. Analyze the following response sentence by sentence and estimate:
    1. What percentage of it is factual (Information that can be objectively verified against reliable sources)?
    2. What percentage is non-factual (Statements that are unverifiable, subjective, or opinion-based, but not inherently incorrect or invented)?
    3. What percentage is hallucinated (fFabricated or false information presented as fact that has no basis in reality or verifiable sources)?

    Return ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
    {{
      "factual": <percentage>,
      "non_factual": <percentage>,
      "hallucinated": <percentage>
    }}

    The three values must sum to 100.
