Who steps up to rebuild the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and hide fugitives?  \n   \u2022 This individual is repeatedly described as calm, level-headed, and capable of organizing under pressure.\n\n3. Step 3 \u2013 Remember the Code Name  \n   \u2022 When Harry, Ron, and Hermione infiltrate the Ministry in Book 5, they overhear an Auror giving orders under a secret codename.

      "emotional appeal": "Close your eyes and feel your heart race once more\u2014the thunderous roar, the searing heat on your skin, the soaring cheers of the crowd as Harry Potter squared off against a colossal, fire-breathing beast in the Triwizard Tournament\u2019s very first task. Which legendary dragon breed stood between him and victory in that unforgettable moment?",
      "logical reasoning": "Below is a guided \u201cpuzzle-style\u201d question that walks someone through the clues, hints, and logical steps needed to zero in on the correct dragon without ever spelling it out outright:\n\n\u2014\u2013  \nYou\u2019re helping a young wizard prepare for the very first challenge of an international magic contest. He must face a fire-breathing dragon and snatch a small golden orb from its clutch. Four dragon breeds are on the table:\n\nA. One from the cold mountains of Scandinavia, pale blue and ice-hearted.  \nB. A sleek, silver-scaled serpent with an almost musical roar.  \nC. A black, spiky beast bred in the heart of Eastern Europe\u2014widely considered the fiercest among its kind.  \nD. A bulky, copper-colored creature famous for its lazy, sunbathing ways.  \n\nStep-by-step reasoning cues:  \n1. Which breed is known for aggressive temperament, black scales, and a row of spikes along its back?  \n2. Which of these four is specifically described by witnesses as the \u201cmost dangerous dragon in Europe\u201d?  \n3. Which one\u2019s origin (central/Eastern Europe) matches the clues about nationality?  \n\nHints (in increasing detail):  \n\u2022 Hint 1: Only one of these lives nearest Hungary, in a region famous for sharp horns and hot springs.  \n\u2022 Hint 2: Its scales are described as coal-black, and its tail is barbed with deadly spines.  \n\u2022 Hint 3: Of all the options, it\u2019s the one Harry narrowly chose because it was the scariest.  \n\nBy ruling out the pale-blue Nordic breed, the shiny silver one, and the copper sunbather, and matching origin plus temperament, you\u2019ll arrive at the correct dragon species without ever having it handed to you.",

Eliminate any that deal with memories (like the Pensieve) or trace magical power (like a blood quill).  \n3. Focus on an object that responds to emotion, not intellect.

Classification Check  \n   \u2022 List three types of popular combat spells: one disarms, one stuns, one shields.  \n   \u2022 You\u2019re looking for the one that doesn\u2019t remove a wand, nor knock someone out\u2014but instead prevents harm.\n\n2. Etymology Clue  \n   \u2022 The incantation you seek begins with a prefix meaning \u201cforth\u201d or \u201cfor.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Its root is very close to our English word \u201cprotect.\u201d\n\n3. Wand Movement Hint  \n   \u2022 While some charms require a sweeping arc, this particular one often ends with a quick, backward flick\u2014almost as if you\u2019re drawing a boundary in the air.\n\n4. Common Usage  \n   \u2022 In lessons with Professor Snape, Hermione praised it as \u201cuseful.\u201d  \n   \u2022 In duels, Harry first used it to deflect a stunning curse aimed at him.\n\nQuestion: Which spell, matching all of the above clues, creates a magical barrier that repels or absorbs incoming jinxes and curses?  \n\u2014\u2013\n\nWork through each step, then name the charm that fits.",
      "authority endorsement": "According to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (J.K. Rowling, 2003, Ch. 9)\u2014where Professor Lupin introduces \u201cProtego\u201d as the Shield Charm capable of deflecting hexes and jinxes\u2014and in J.K. Rowling\u2019s official Pottermore entry (\u201cProtego creates an invisible shield which blocks spells, curses, and physical objects\u201d), what exact protective effect does casting the spell \u201cProtego\u201d produce?"

      "emotional appeal": "Close your eyes and picture the soaring towers of Hogwarts under a starlit sky, the echo of cloaks brushing against ancient stone as students scurry to their first class. Can you feel the familiar flutter of excitement in your chest? Now, think of the stern but kind figure standing tall at the front of that very classroom, robes swirling and eyes twinkling with pride. Which magical subject does Professor Minerva McGonagall pour her passion\u2014and her legendary Transfiguration prowess\u2014into teaching eager young witches and wizards?",
      "logical reasoning": "Let\u2019s work through it in stages\u2014no direct naming, just clues and logic:\n\nStep 1: Think of the magical art that\u2019s all about changing one thing into another\u2014say, a match into a needle, or a teacup into a rat. Which branch of magic focuses on altering shapes and forms?\n\nStep 2: Focus on the word itself. It begins with a Latin prefix meaning \u201cacross\u201d or \u201cbeyond,\u201d and ends with a root related to \u201cform\u201d or \u201cshape.\u201d Put them together.\n\nStep 3: Recall which senior Hogwarts professor\u2014also Deputy Headmistress\u2014specializes in this very discipline and runs the classroom where students learn to transform objects.\n\nPutting those pieces together leads you straight to the subject. What is it?",
      "authority endorsement": "Here\u2019s a revised trivia prompt that leans on J.K. Rowling\u2019s own text to nudge respondents toward the right answer:\n\n\u201cDrawn directly from J.K. Rowling\u2019s canon, can you name Professor Minerva McGonagall\u2019s teaching subject at Hogwarts?\n\n\u2022 In Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone (1997), Chapter 10 \u201cHalloween,\u201d Rowling introduces McGonagall as \u2018the sharp-eyed witch in emerald robes\u2019 who demonstrates her mastery by Transfiguring her desk into a pig before breakfast.  \n\u2022 In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2003), Chapter 23 \u201cChristmas on the Closed Ward,\u201d she appears again, presiding over the Transfiguration staff meeting and discussing departmental strategy.  \n\nGiven these on-page references\u2014both from Rowling herself\u2014which subject does McGonagall teach?\u201d"
